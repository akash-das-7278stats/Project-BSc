# Project-BSc
One of the most popular design for analyzing the effects of different treatments among different groups of population is Rectangular Block Design (RBD). In practice we may come across situations where one observationis missing due to some reason. This leads to a very big problem in RBD set up, as we can’t just remove the missing data from our design, unlike Completely Randomizes Design (CRD). Thus various missing plot techniques can be performed to construct the concerned tests which reflects an approximation of the true nature the population characteristics, we are interested in. This project is mainly focused on investigating numerically how much accurate these testing procedures are. Here we use simulation to visualize and demonstrate the relation and accuracy of different testing procedure empirically.
